    <h3>User Synchronisation</h3>

    This plugin provides automatic synchronisation between the user accounts stored in the AudiencePlayer backend and
    those
    stored in the Wordpress website. This functionality is required for most of the features this plugin provides, such
    as
    3rd party payments and entitled/purchased video content. Before enabling it, please pay close attention to the
    following
    notes:

    <ol class="audienceplayer-admin-ol">
        <li>
            Begin by configuring the credentials (see AudiencePlayer CMS: "Project configuration > Integrations") in the
            configuration section <a
                href="?page={{SECTION_CONFIGURATION_PAGE_SLUG}}&tab={{SECTION_CONFIGURATION_TAB_API_PAGE_SLUG}}">{{SECTION_CONFIGURATION_TAB_API_TITLE}}</a>,
            you can activate user synchronisation there as well.<br/>
            <span class="audienceplayer-admin-warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: When activated, all user actions taken such
            as deleting a user in Wordpress, will immediately be applied to the AudiencePlayer backend!!! Keep this in
            mind especially while still testing/developing in your Wordpress environment!!!</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you enable users to register via another channel than the website (e.g. TV-apps, mobile apps etc), then
            <a href="mailto:support@audienceplayer.com">contact</a> AudiencePlayer to ensure two-way synchronisation is
            enabled for your account. That ensures that users will also be able to login via the Wordpress website.
        </li>
        <li>
            When activated, moderators may inspect the synchronisation status <a href="/wp-admin/users.php">per user</a>
            and
            re-synchronise accounts as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            When activated, any Wordpress user (including admins!) can ONLY login with e-mail address and password
            (username
            will NOT be accepted).
        </li>
        <li>
            When NOT activated, users will NOT be synchronised and after logging into Wordpress, may encounter problems
            using certain features such as product/subscription purchase, playback of purchased/entitled videos etc.
            This
            can result in error messages such as "user not synchronised" or error code "407".
        </li>
        <li>
            Besides e-mail, password, first_name and last_name, you may wish to collect additional user metadata in
            Wordpress e.g. during registration, such as birthdays, address etc.
            The following meta properties (in the user_meta table) can be synchronised with the AudiencePlayer
            backend, if
            you conform to the following property names:
            <ul class="audienceplayer-admin-ul-level1">
                <li><em>address</em>: string value containing the address/street name, e.g. "Bakerstreet 123"</li>
                <li><em>postal_code</em>: string value containing the postal/zip code, e.g. "1245CT"</li>
                <li><em>city</em>: string value containing city name, e.g. "Amsterdam"</li>
                <li><em>country</em>: string value containing two-digit country code, e.g. "NL"</li>
                <li><em>gender</em>: string value containing the gender, supported values: ["male", "female",
                    "non_binary",
                    "unknown"]
                </li>
                <li><em>height</em>: numeric value containing the height in centimeters (cm), e.g. "185"</li>
                <li><em>weight</em>: numeric value containing the weight in kilograms (kg), e.g. "75"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Developers note: There are many Wordpress hooks addressed by this plugin to achieve redundant User
            synchronisation. If you use code and/or other plugins that affect user management and/or authentication, the
            hooks listed below deserve special attention should you use them as well. For a thorough overview, see the
            plugin file "BootstrapTrait.php" for the exact implementation.<br/>
            <ul class="audienceplayer-admin-ul-level1">
                <li><em>user_register</em>: synchronise user, add user</li>
                <li><em>email_change_email</em>: synchronise user</li>
                <li><em>user_profile_update_errors</em>: synchronise user, create user</li>
                <li><em>registration_errors</em>: synchronise user, create user</li>
                <li><em>delete_user</em>: synchronise user, delete user</li>
                <li><em>deleted_user</em>: synchronise user user</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
