        To get your AudiencePlayer integration up to speed, customised
        <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode" target="_new">Wordpress shortcodes</a> are available for the
        most
        important features (see overview below).
        Style, layout and business logic contained in these shortcodes can easily be overwritten, or simply used
        as a development template for your own customised integration (in which case, please also see the help section
        <a href="?page={{SECTION_HELP_PAGE_SLUG}}&tab={{SECTION_HELP_TAB_CODE_EXAMPLES_PAGE_SLUG}}">{{SECTION_HELP_TAB_CODE_EXAMPLES_TITLE}}</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        To overwrite, simply copy the relevant file(s) into a matching folder/file structure in your active "theme"
        folder.
        The plugin will first look here for the relevant files, and fallback to its own templates.<br/>
        For example, copy the file: <strong>/wp-content/plugins/audienceplayer/templates/audienceplayer-shortcode-article-detail.php</strong><br/>
        to:
        <strong>/wp-content/themes/twentytwenty/audienceplayer/templates/audienceplayer-shortcode-article-detail.php</strong><br/>
        and modify it there to suit your requirements.

            By default, the plugin makes a modal video player available which is based on the <a

        </li>
        <li>
            By default, the plugin makes a few simple modal dialogs available to either allow the user to interact (e.g.
            conduct a purchase) or to inform the user.<br/>

        <li>
            By default, the plugin makes a generic video page available (see shortcode [audienceplayer_article_detail])
            to which a user can be redirected when clicking on thumbnails in an Article carousel or grid.
            The url-paths of these generic pages, as well as the default click-behaviour of Article carousels/grids can
            be
            configured in the section <a

        <li>
            By default, the plugin makes a few simple translations available which are fully synchronised with
            AudiencePlayer and can be managed in the AudiencePlayer CMS. If needed, you may overwrite and/or customise
            them as you see fit, e.g. to accommodate your own custom multi-language setup.

            The business logic and/or templates may be improved and modified over time, as this plugin evolves. If you
            use the shortcodes with templates as offered out-of-the-box, it is advised to review the changes and or test
            these on your own test/staging environment, before deploying them to your production environment.

    This shortcode allows you to easily integrate a carousel. It uses the simple <a
        href="https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" target="_blank">Slick carousel plugin</a>.
    The main attributes to control the carousel content are "category_id" to display all articles within a given
    category,
    and "ancestor_id" to display all the descendant articles for a given parent article (e.g. display all lectures
    within a series).
    By default, clicking a thumbnail will open the modal video player. This behaviour can be overridden with attribute
    "click_action".
    <br/>
    The respective php/html template is shared with shortcode "[audienceplayer_article_grid]".

    This shortcode allows you to easily integrate a grid. The main attributes to control the carousel content are
