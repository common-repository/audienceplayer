    <h3>General considerations</h3>


    <p>
        When setting up your AudiencePlayer integration in Wordpress, please pay close attention to the following
        general
        considerations:
    </p>
    <ul class="audienceplayer-admin-ul">
        <li><strong>CREDENTIALS</strong> : Ensure that the AudiencePlayer OAuth credentials are never exposed on your
            production website (e.g. mind debug settings and error handling).
            Automatic synchronisation of all user accounts between Wordpress and the AudiencePlayer backend. Moderators
            may
            In general, it is strongly advised to pay close attention to the security of your Wordpress site.
        </li>
        <li><strong>SECURITY</strong> : We strongly advise you to setup security measures such as
            "IP-Firewall/whitelisting"
            and "rate-limiting". This is especially important if you have enabled AudiencePlayer User synchronisation
            (enabled by default), which greatly expands the automatic actions that this plugin takes, such as creating,
            modifying and deleting users!
            <br/>
            There are many <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/security/"
                              target="_blank">security plugins</a> available in the Wordpress ecosystem to consider.
            Since the AudiencePlayer backend may also actively
            synchronise user data with this Wordpress website, ensure that these actions are allowed in your setup (e.g.
            by
            your Firewall plugin).
        </li>
        <li><strong>HTTP/SSL</strong> : Ensure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS/SSL</a> is
            ALWAYS
            implemented on your Wordpress website. Not only does it dramatically increase overall security, it is also
            required for 3rd party payment and encrypted video playback, facilitated by this plugin.
        </li>
        <li><strong>IN PRODUCTION</strong> : While in production, before upgrading this plugin always <strong>first
            test</strong> on your test/staging environment. Plugin releases follow <a href="https://semver.org/"
                                                                                      target="_blank">semantic
            versioning</a>: Patch and minor updates are typically always safe roll out, however major version updates
            may change or break existing functionality which may impact your integration. In any case, it is
            <strong>always</strong> recommended you test first.
        </li>
        <li><strong>TROUBLESHOOTING</strong> : This plugin keeps its own log files, mainly of the User Synchronisation
            efforts, which can be viewed in the section <a
                    href="?page={{SECTION_LOGS_PAGE_SLUG}}&tab={{SECTION_LOGS_TAB_OVERVIEW_PAGE_SLUG}}">{{SECTION_LOGS_TAB_OVERVIEW_TITLE}}</a>.
            They can be useful in case of any problems.
        </li>
    </ul>
