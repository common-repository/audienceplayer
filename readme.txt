== Description ==

This plugin allows you to integrate the AudiencePlayer Video Platform API into WordPress. It provides:

* Automatic synchronisation of all user accounts between WordPress and the AudiencePlayer backend.
* Shortcodes to integrate AudiencePlayer functionality in your WordPress site.

After installing the plugin, an extensive HELP section is available under the new menu item "AudiencePlayer".
AudiencePlayer configurations and translations e.g. for dialogues and video Articles, are automatically synchronised.

This plugin relies on the following external AudiencePlayer libraries, via which user profile data is exchanged with the AudiencePlayer Backend:
